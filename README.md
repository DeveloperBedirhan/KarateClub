# KarateClub
There are students, instructors and lesson groups in the karate club. The ID number, name, surname and birthday information of students and teachers are stored. The name of the groups, their level, the instructor, the student who is a member of the group, and the date of membership are stored. Necessary triggers were written in the karate club database to ensure data integrity, and the necessary queries were made for the names and surnames of students who are not members of any group and the number of students in the group they teach for each instructor.
